# Metodos Numericos 2

This repository contains my updated solutions to the practical excercises of Numerical Methods II.

The main goal of this repo is to give my teachers access for my latest solutions that may differ from the ones I submitted as they may have been revised while studding. The .zip files are the ones that have been submitted and tags are pointing to the latest commit an excercise solution was modified before submision. New solutions can be seen in the excercise folder and will be listed on tge Updates section of this file.
